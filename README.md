- Utilizes Random Forest and Decision Tree models for 5G network optimization.
- Compares the performance of the models using regression metrics.
- Provides insights into the effectiveness of machine learning in optimizing 5G networks.

## Introduction

5G networks demand optimal performance to meet the high-speed, low-latency requirements of modern communication. This project employs machine learning, specifically Random Forest and Decision Tree models, to optimize 5G network parameters. By training on historical data, the models can predict and adjust network configurations to enhance performance.

### Why Random Forest and Decision Tree?

Random Forest and Decision Tree models are well-suited for regression tasks in optimization scenarios. Their ability to capture complex relationships in the data makes them valuable tools for predicting and optimizing 5G network parameters. The comparison between these models provides insights into their strengths and weaknesses in the context of network optimization.
